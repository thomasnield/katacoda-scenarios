##Â Getting Started

This environment has been set up to have a simple function called `regex_match(regex, str)`, which is what we will use to test our regular expressions with. 

The first argument `regex` is where our regular expression will be provided, and the second `str` is going to be the string we are matching against. It will print either `MATCH` or `NO MATCH`. 

Try running the following example:

`regex_match(regex="[A-Z]{2}", str="TX")`{{execute}}

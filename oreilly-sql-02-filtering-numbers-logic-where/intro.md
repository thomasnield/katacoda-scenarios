# Filter Numbers and Logic with WHERE

Filtering a large dataset down to records of interest is a fundamental task in analyzing and engineering data. In this scenario, we will filter records in a SELECT query using numerical and logical operators to hone in on data of interest. 

We will be using SQLite as our platform to practice, but these operators should largely apply to all SQL and relational database platforms including MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server. 

Please give the environment a moment to set up. The console should clear and have a sqlite3 > prompt when ready.

# Regular Expressions: Prefix, Suffix, and Named Groups 

In this Katacoda scenario, we are going to learn about the prefix, suffix, and named groups in regular expressions. We will be practicing this knowledge within a Python environment. However you should be able to transfer this knowledge to other platforms you work with.

Many data science, data engineering, and technology professionals have encountered regular expressions at some point. This esoteric, miniature language is used for matching complex text patterns, and looks mysterious and intimidating at first. However, regular expressions (also called “regex”) are a powerful tool that only require a small time investment to learn. They are almost ubiquitously supported wherever there is data. Several analytical and technology platforms support them, including SQL, Python, R, Alteryx, Tableau, LibreOffice, Java, Scala, .NET, and Go. Major text editors and IDE’s like Atom Editor, Notepad++, Emacs, Vim, Intellij IDEA, and PyCharm also support searching files with regular expressions.

Regular expressions offer universal utility and surprisingly, they do not have a steep learning curve. If you frequently find yourself manually scanning documents or parsing substrings just to identify text patterns, you might want to give them a try! Especially in data science and data engineering, they can assist in a wide spectrum of tasks, from wrangling data to qualifying and categorizing it.

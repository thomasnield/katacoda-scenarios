We have come to the end of the regular expression Katacoda scenarios! Using the prefix, suffix, and named group constructs are advanced regular expression functionalities that can achieve some powerful contextual matching. Keep practicing them and the next time you search your code or document files, try to use regular expresions.

It is important to remember that you often only need to make a regular expression as specific as it needs to be, depending on how predictable your data is. Qualifying a number with `[0-9.]+` will work to match an IP address such as `172.18.83.200`. But keep in mind it will also match `237476231.345342342334.23423756756856234`, which is definitely not an IP address. If you do not know your data well, you should probably err on being more specific, as demonstrated in this [Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5284147/validating-ipv4-addresses-with-regexp).

Regular expressions may seem niche, but they can rise up heroically to the most unexpected tasks in your day-to-day work. Hopefully this Katacoda has helped you feel more comfortable with regular expressions and find them useful. They can assist in data munging, qualification, categorization, and parsing as well as document editing.

# Retrieving Data with SELECT

In this exercise, we will be practicing some basic data retrieval with the `SELECT` command. Basic expressions and transformations will also be covered. 

We will be using SQLite as our platform to practice, but these operators should largely apply to all SQL and relational database platforms. 

Please give the environment a moment to set up. The console should clear and have a `sqlite3 >` prompt when ready.

We have finished covering anchoring, an undercovered but necessary functionality in regular expressions. Not only do they allow us to match on the start and end of a line or string, but act as an insurance policy to force full matches across all platforms. 

Regular expressions may seem niche, but they can rise up heroically to the most unexpected tasks in your day-to-day work. Hopefully this Katacoda has helped you feel more comfortable with regular expressions and find them useful. They can assist in data munging, qualification, categorization, and parsing as well as document editing.

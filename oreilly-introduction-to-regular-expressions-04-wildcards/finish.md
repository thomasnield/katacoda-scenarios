Declaring wildcards with the dot `.` operator gives us the ability to make broad rules that capture larger pieces of text with patterns we care less about, while qualifying the ones we do care about. Use them carefully, as we want to prefer specificity in our matching logic. 

Regular expressions may seem niche, but they can rise up heroically to the most unexpected tasks in your day-to-day work. Hopefully this Katacoda has helped you feel more comfortable with regular expressions and find them useful. They can assist in data munging, qualification, categorization, and parsing as well as document editing.

If you have gotten this far, congratulations. When you start using quantifiers, regular expressions become more than just an alternative to wildcards, but rather a powerful tool that truly expresses pattern logic. 

Regular expressions may seem niche, but they can rise up heroically to the most unexpected tasks in your day-to-day work. Hopefully this Katacoda has helped you feel more comfortable with regular expressions and find them useful. They can assist in data munging, qualification, categorization, and parsing as well as document editing.
